This is a simple Java application to randomly select images from filessystem and display them on screen. The intention is to use it as a replacement of standard Microsoft Photos screensaver. In my opinion this one has a better randomizer, and also allows to freeze a picture and see its location.

In order to turn it to a screensaver:

1. export project to a runnable jar file
2. wrap the jar to exe with launch4j
3. rename file.exe to file.scr
4. install filse.scr
